  <h1>Who gets remembered in our streets?</h1>

  <p>
    This website documents streets named after people across multiple European cities. 
    For each street, it identifies whether it is eponymic and, if so, provides information on the person commemorated, such as gender, occupation, nationality, and year of birth. 
    The data is mainly derived from Wikidata and standardised to allow comparisons between cities.  
    It enables users to compare cities, examine gender imbalances, and analyse which professions and historical periods are most frequently honoured.

  <p>
    In <strong>Paris</strong>, 2,725 streets are named after people.
    <strong>2,569</strong> honour men, while <strong>156</strong> are named after women, which correspond to <strong>6%</strong>. In <strong>Debrecen</strong>, the imbalance is even sharper. Out of 273 eponymic streets, <strong>265</strong> are named after men
    and just <strong>8</strong> after women, less than <strong>3%</strong>. Beyond numbers, the occupation of these women who are remembered in the streets differs too. In Paris, most streets are associated with <strong>culture</strong>
    (<strong>36%</strong>), while in Debrecen nearly half (<strong>44.4%</strong>) are linked to <strong>politics</strong>.
