  <h1>Who gets remembered in our streets? </h1>

  <p>
    This website documents streets named after people across multiple European cities. 
    For each street, it identifies whether it is eponymic and, if so, provides information on the person remembered, such as gender, occupation, year of birth and nationality. 
    The data is mainly derived from Wikidata and standardised to allow comparisons between cities.  
    It enables users to examine gender imbalances and to analyse which occupations, historical periods and nationalities are most frequently honoured.
