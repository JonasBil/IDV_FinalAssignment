  <h1>Who gets remembered in our streets?</h1>

  <p>
    In <strong>Paris</strong>, 2,725 streets are named after people.
    <strong>2,569</strong> honour men, while <strong>156</strong> are named after women, which correspond to <strong>6%</strong>. In <strong>Debrecen</strong>, the imbalance is even sharper. Out of 273 eponymic streets, <strong>265</strong> are named after men
    and just <strong>8</strong> after women, less than <strong>3%</strong>. Beyond numbers, the occupation of these women who are remembered in the streets differs too. In Paris, most streets are associated with <strong>culture</strong>
    (<strong>37.2%</strong>), while in Debrecen nearly half (<strong>44.4%</strong>) are linked to <strong>politics</strong>.
